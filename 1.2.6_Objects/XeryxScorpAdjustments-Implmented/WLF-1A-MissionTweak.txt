I am playing the Scorp's nest and I had to make a few tweaks to the mechs used. Mainly because I am testing the use dates to make sure they work however the WLF-1A cannot be used because the scanner may not be discovered through the other FP. But I also tweaked a couple of other mechs in missions three and four.
