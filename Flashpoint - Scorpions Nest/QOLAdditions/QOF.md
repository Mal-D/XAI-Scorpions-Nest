## Quality of Life additions.
This is just a collection  of Quality of Life files to replace the ones in the original release. They will be eventually added into a new version should they greatly affect the Functioning of the Flashpoint. 

### Flashpoint Contract colours

The ColourfulFlashPoints mod controls the Colours internally of things like the pulsing Flashpoint marker and Contract colours. Should you wish to tone the contract colours down to a less strident green then try this settings.json file.
If you want adjust it further manually, just make a copy of the settings file and call it something like settings.orig and then adjust your settings.json file the ColourfulFlashpoint folder.
If you ae happy to trust my selection just copy the folder in the archive over the folder in your /Mods folder and replace it's content - don't fret there is only one file in that folder.

### The Commander has a name.
The name of your Commander was removed from the mission descriptions and in-mission general chatter due to an issue with the HBS original coding. This is a simple replacement of the two folders /Contracts and /dialogue_buckets.

### The Enemy Objectives now have names.
Discovering the versatility of CWolf's Mission Control. 
The contracts are populated using Mission control Additional Lances feature and the opposing forces now have custom Objective names for you to focus your fire upon.
These actually don't reside in the Flashpoint but in their own folder in Mission Control. Drag the MissionControl folder in the QoL package into the /Mods folder directly and the folder structure in the QoL package will correctly place the updates in the 
/Mods/MissionControl/config/Contracts/scorpionsNest folder.
